## Challanges

In the following tabs we will explain what the challanges are about

### Challange 1: Insecure Login Form

This challange consists of the following:

You need to try login/find the credentials for a user. When the credenstials are found put them into the login form, you will get a pop-up that shows if you where successful or not.

### Challange 2: URL Manipulation

Admin pages just like you might have with Wordpress wp-admin. Its your job to use whatever your capable of to find the page. this can be just by trying different urls or by using tools specified for this purpose

### Challange 3: Cookie Manipulation

Change a normal user to an admin by changing the id
but you first need to find where and how to do that
